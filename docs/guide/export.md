# Exporting data

## CSV

All [Asset](/guide/assets), [Log](/guide/logs), and
[Quantity](/guide/quantities) lists in farmOS include an "Export CSV" link at
the bottom that will generate and download a CSV file. Any sorts or filters
that are applied to the list will be represented in the CSV output.

## KML

The *farmOS KML* module provides an option for exporting the geometry of one or
more Assets or Logs. Open any list of Assets or Logs, select the ones you want
to include in your export, and select the "Export KML" option that appears at
the bottom. A new KML file will be generated with all the geometries that were
selected.
